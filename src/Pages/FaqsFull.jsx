          Will my website be mobile-friendly?
        </h3>
        <p className="text-black text-base mb-12">
          Yes! All our designs are responsive, meaning they’ll look and function
          great on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This is vital for ranking
          in Google search results.

        </h3>
        <p className="text-black text-base mb-12">
          We can do both! If your current website just needs some tweaks, we’re
          happy to update it. If it’s outdated or not performing well, a fresh
          design might be the best way to boost your online presence.

          Absolutely! Our FastTrack Builds uses user-friendly content management
          systems (like Wix) so you can make updates yourself. We include a user
          guide in the handover process.
